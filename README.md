# Algorithm Visualization Project

Welcome to Algorithm Learning Tool project! I've created a user-friendly platform to help you understand and explore various algorithms.
In this project, visual representations of popular algorithms are tested using E2E Cypress and Jest unit tests.

## String Reversal

With String Reversal feature, you can easily flip a piece of text. Simply enter the text you want to reverse and click the "Reverse" button.

## Fibonacci Sequence

Discover the world of Fibonacci numbers with this tool. Enter a number 'n', and the tool will generate the Fibonacci sequence up to that value when you click "Generate."

## Sorting an Array

Learn how different sorting methods work using array sorting tool. You can choose between selection sort and bubble sort. Pick your preferred method, sort the array in ascending or descending order, and create a new array for more practice.

## Stack

Explore the concept of a stack, a data structure that follows the Last-In-First-Out (LIFO) principle. Add, remove, and clear elements from the stack, and watch the visual representation of this data structure in action.

## Queue

Dive into the world of queues, which follow the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) principle. Add, remove, and clear elements from the queue, and observe how it works with visual representation.

## Linked List

Discover linked lists, a fundamental data structure. Add, remove, and manipulate elements in a linked list, and see the changes in real-time with visual display.
